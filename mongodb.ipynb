    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans: Mongodb is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that helps for querying and indexing.A non-relational database stores data in  a non-tabular form and tends to be more flexible than the traditional, SQL-based,relational database structure.\n",
    "MongoDB is more scalable and faster.We should use MongoDB over SQL database when we want to accomodate large amount of data."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans: 1. Adhoc queries for optimized,real-time analytics: An ad-hoc query is a short-lived command whose value depends on a variable.\n",
    "2. Indexing appropriately for better query execution: indexes are intended to improve search speed and performance.\n",
    "3. Replication for better data availability and stability\n",
    "4. Sharding: the process of splitting large dataset across multiple distributed collection for better execution\n",
    "5. Load Balancing: Properly distributing millions of client requests to hundreds or thousands of servers can lead to a noticeable difference in performance.\n",
    "6. Document Model: It is a document-oriented database which stores data as documents and documents are grouped in collections.\n",
    "7. Authentication: Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the database.\n",
    "8. Database Triggers: Database triggers in MongoDB is a powerful feature that allow you to execute code when certain events occur in your database."
