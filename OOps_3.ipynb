    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "Ans: The abc module in python library provides the infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes. 'abc' works by marking method of the base class as abstract.This is done by the @abstractmethod decorator. 'abc' is used to make the method of the abstract class as a abstract method."
